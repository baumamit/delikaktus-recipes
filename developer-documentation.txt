Tools for creating a great recipes blog, including interactive and dynamic blocks. Created and designed by actual chefs of the DELIKAKTUS.com team.


== Plugin Translation ==
All translation strings are created in the folder "languages" under the plugin main folder.

Terminal command for generating the basic .pot translation file:
php -d memory_limit=1024M C:\wp-cli\wp-cli.phar i18n make-pot . languages/delikaktus-recipes.pot --exclude=vendor,node_modules,build,dist,assets

In the seperately installed Poedit, create a new translation from the .pot file, and save in the file name format:
delikaktus-recipes-it_IT.po
delikaktus-recipes-en_EN.po
and so on...

After adding new translation strings in any of the files, run again the terminal command to generate the updated .pot file.
Then open the .po file, and in the top menu choose translation --> Update from POT file... => choose the file and approve
